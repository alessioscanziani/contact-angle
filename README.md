# contact-angle
Codes for computing contact angles from 3D tomograms

These codes can be used to compute contact angles from multiphase images where the interface between two phases is in contact with a solid surface. The codes use Avizo and Matlab to extract 2D slices from 3D images and compute the contact angles. The images are supposed to be 3D segmented images, where 3 phases (two fluids and one solid) are present.

Please download the codes and read the instructions in readme.txt to use the codes

The codes work properly with Thermo Fisher Avizo 9.5 and Matlab R2019a
